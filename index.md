# Introduction {-}

This is a reference sheet for common uses of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) in CRSS 8010, Research Methods & Design in Crop Science. It is not exhaustive, but should cover all the basic function calls you need to analyze our data. Please use the navigation bar at left to go through this site.

If you want any of the data files used in the demo code, you can download them from the [data](./data/) directory.

This guide was built using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package for R.
